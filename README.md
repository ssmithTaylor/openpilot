What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported [car makes, models and model years](#supported-cars). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers.

## My fork
My fork is focused on live tuning with a few extra experimental features. If there's a tunable parameter missing, open a new issue and I'll add it as fast as I can. 

## Installation
Easiest way is with this command:

`git clone https://github.com/jamcar23/openpilot.git --branch r2++ --depth 1`

Using the `r2++` branch is the easiest way to get the latest "release" features of this fork. Generally, all features are optional so there shouldn't be any harm is always running the latest features.
